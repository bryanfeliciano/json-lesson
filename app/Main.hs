-- Unfortunately, if you try to automatically derive ToJSON and FromJSON, your programs will
-- expect an errorCode field instead of error. If you were in control of this JSON, you could
-- rename the field, but youâ€™re not. You need another solution to this problem.
-- To make your ErrorMessage type an instance of FromJSON, you need to define one function:
-- parseJSON. You can do this in the following way.

instance FromJSON ErrorMessage where
   parseJSON (Object v) =
   ErrorMessage <$> v .: "message"
